                Hidden navigation: Instead of the traditional global navigation bar with several categories, the Bucknell site has an extremely narrow and deep hierarchy, with just 2 menu items: Start Exploring, (which has a drop-down for audience-based navigation) and The Everything Directory(which leads to an A-Z index). A deep hierarchy usually ends up with more generic labels at the top.

                Unused fancy tools:None of the users noticed or interacted with the Recently viewed pages tool because the icon of a clock isn’t familiar on websites.

          We decided to implement the following principles and found that many of the actionable items on the original interface were not clearly marked and it was confusing to the user as to whether they could actually click on them.
          <p>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> group by distance or location - moved label closer to buttons on the bottom half of the screen
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Similarity:</strong> group by type - Made all clickable areas buttons by making them the same shape. Cancel and save are related by color and Repeat, Label and Sound options are related by a different color.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Figure-Ground:</strong> grouping by depth - All clickable items have a gradient and a drop shadow creating depth. The background area of the interface is also gray so that user perceives that as the background versus all of the actionable items being on the white foreground
          </p>

          <p>
              <strong>Closure:</strong> grouping by pattern so that the user perceives shapes that are not actually there - The numbers in the clock appear together on the screen arranged as a circle.

          </header>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              <strong>Equitable Use:</strong> All people are able to use and access information regardless of disabilities.As we started our redesign we decided to keep people with different visual impairments in mind, including color blindness, blindness, and weak vision. There were plenty of issues with the original design that would make it difficult for people with visual impairments to gather all the information they needed to book a flight. 
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Designed for Weak Vision:</strong> One issue we found was that a lot of the text on the screen was very small, thin and light gray. This made it difficult to read, even for us, who do not have any visual impairments. In order to resolve this issue we increased the contrast of all the text on the background, as well as used a heavier weight font. This increased the contrast of the text from the background, making it more legible.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <strong>Designed for Text Readers:</strong> The current website has several areas of text that are bitmap images instead of html text. This inhibits the text reader from reading that area of text aloud to the user. We replaced these images in the headers as well as in the advertisement image with html text, so that text readers can properly help a blind user navigate through the page. We also reduced the mouse over interactions that were being used with the icons. We added labels to the icons that were on the page, in order to make those accessible to the text reader as well.
            </p>
  
            <p>
                <strong>Designed for Color Blindness:</strong> We decided to keep a similar color palette as the original, while increasing the contrast between the colors used. The high contrast monogamous blue color palette is viewable by people of differing color acuity. We tested our redesigned webpage through a color blindness simulator to ensure that all of the text and visual hierarchy was easily viewable by people of different abilities. 
              </p>
