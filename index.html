                <li>The wearer can control the gauntlet depending on the needs of the wearer and hence the the

                  from.</li>
                <li>Its indestructible and so it can be used under any weather or climatic conditions.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2> Whiteboarding and Ideation</h2>
              <h3>MindMapping,Chainstorming</h3>

              <img class="img-center" src="projects/images/infinity/mindmap.svg" />
              <p>Map was created to connect the user ,task and environment analysis of the user
                and create the functionality and use of the device.</p>
              <p>I used mind mapping and chain storming technique for the individual brainstorming knowing the facts
                about
                the device.Mind mapping technique involves in creating a map between the device and the input and
                output and
                establish connection with the device. </p>
              <p>Considering the way the device functions in the real comic and movies.
                <p>I considered Mind ,gestures ,screen and some unknown interface which I was trying to figure out how
                  that
                  would interact with the device.For gestures I thought of using unique gestures for each task or for
                  each
                  infinity gem and the user can use the gesture to invoke the power of the infinity gem. </p>
                <p>The advantage of doing so is that all ideas were written down by not ignoring the small details and
                  that
                  helped me map the input interactions and the feedback mechanism. </p>
                <p>After the brainstorming, came up with different interfaces</p>
                <ol>
                  <li> Use of a horizontal touch bar at the end of the gauntlet that could show the options and so that
                    the user
                    gets to know how to operate it through a mental model.</li>
                  <li>Using gestures and a screen: to record the gestures created by the user to enable the power of
                    the infinity gem.</li>
                  <li> Introducing the screen on the back of the hand to invoke all the options present for the
                    interaction.</li>
                  <li> Creating a knob with the mind stone, letting the mind stone gauge all the data and operate the
                    knob to invoke all the power.
                    Also with another knob outside to create a multi level hierarchy to choose the options given.</li>
                  <li> Using touch on the gauntlet of each finger that consists the power can invoke the power of the
                    infinity stone for multiple options.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2> PAPER PROTOTYPE </h2>
                <h3>Role Playing</h3>
                <img src="./projects/images/infinity/proto.svg" />
                <p>
                  While Role playing,I used sticky notes and coloured papers to understand where the screen can be
                  placed
                  and how can the user use the gauntlet with the screen? What are the transition from one screen to
                  another?
                  <br /> What are the options to consider when the user has to choose the options for a particular
                  task?
                  <br />The low fidelity helped me iterate this process helped me decide how my screen interaction
                  should
                  happend and also made me understand the fucntionality of each task.

                <p>
                  To conceptualize the design with the story of the user, tehcniques such as Extraordinaires and Story
                  boarding was used.Extraordinates was created to understandthe story line for the user using the
                  interface considering the task of the interaction.Rather give a brief of what is happening for a
                  scenario.
                </p>
                <img src="./projects/images/infinity/storyboard.svg" />
                <p>
                  Storyboarding was created to understant the importance of user using the interface and a need for
                  using an interface by the user.Considering the task analysis I choose two task to show the user using
                  the
                  interface
                </p>
                <p> To make sense out of all the process, we had to put to gether a use case of the user and interface
                  and had to create a video
                  that could potentially show the use case of the interface and the device.Not very good in editing but
                  tried to use most of ehat I Hadto build a story
                  with the help of Storyboarding created a script and made a video.

                the

                option where users can like the recipe and and later can come back to view the liked

                The application is for the children to improve self advocacy by letting them go through a
                questionaire along side with a game to grow and nurture plants and give them a reason to
                come back to the application on the daily basis which could keep track of their health.The
                children wouldn't know that they are scrutinised and would be honest about the how they
                feel
                everyday and this way the teachers could keep a track of the childrens health</p>

                  that children enjoyed using their the ipads and was comfortable with it .And I decided to
                  design an application for the Ipad or any tablet.Initial design was to involve more pictures
                  and lesser text to engage the students with the application.Based on these requirements ,
                  Had to design the wireframe</p>

                About:
              </h2>
              <p>
                This was my research project at school with two other fellow students.Our motivation for this study
                came from the idea that humans undergo different affective states when learning or completing a task.
                So it can then be assumed that particular affective states could yield different results when
                completing or learning a task, some better than others.
              </p>
              <h2> Approch:</h2>
              <p>
                Our approach for this study focused more so on whether there is a difference in overall performance,
                and whether this difference can be influenced using music.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Music is known to have an effect on the emotional states of people
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    From previous research we know that the tempo modulates the arousal value of the emotions
                    (Fernandez-Sotos et al. 2016)

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We can then assume that certain types of music can be used to evoke certain affective states for an
                    individual
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If applied, music with specific tempos can be used to influence the overall performance of
                    individuals when completing task

                    music with various tempo and rhythm. They were able to conclude that:
                    <i> “..the tempo modulates the arousal value of emotions”
                    </i>

                The main purpose for conducting the usability test for the Create Art center is to address the client
                goals for the website.Another Reason included is to evaluate the possible problems faced during the
                usability of the website and improve the user experience of the website. During this process, I
                documented the information with user analysis along with environmental analysis.
