            <div class="content__item-text">
              <p>When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted with a young American couple who
                had among their belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven—attractive but not practicably
                companionable with me, because he knew no English. He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas
                on his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and would learn no other. The family
                removed to America a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy began to lose his
                Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had
                wholly departed from his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when he was twenty-one, I
                came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York, and the mother told me about an adventure
                which her son had been having. By trade he was now a professional diver. A passenger boat had been
                caught in a storm on the lake, and had gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the
                young diver descended, with his armor on, and entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the
                foot of the companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water. Presently something
                touched him on the shoulder, and he turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and
                seemingly inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with fright.</p>
              <p>His entry had disturbed the water, and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him and
                wagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance. His senses forsook
                him, and in that condition he was drawn to the surface. He was put to bed at home, and was soon very
                ill. During some days he had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; and while they
                lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and Kanaka only. He was still very ill, and he talked
                to me in that tongue; but I did not understand it, of course. The doctor-books tell us that cases like
                this are not uncommon. Then the doctors ought to study the cases and find out how to multiply them.
                Many languages and things get mislaid in a person’s head, and stay mislaid for lack of this remedy.</p>
              <p>Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were sent ashore; but nobody could go ashore
                and return. There were people on shore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we could not
                receive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term in Sydney. They could have escaped the day
                before, by ship to San Francisco; but the bars had been put up, now, and they might have to wait weeks
                before any ship could venture to give them a passage any whither. And there were hardships for others.
                An elderly lady and her son, recreation-seekers from Massachusetts, had wandered westward, further and
                further from home, always intending to take the return track, but always concluding to go still a
                little further; and now here they were at anchor before Honolulu positively their last westward-bound
                indulgence—they had made up their minds to that—but where is the use in making up your mind in this
                world? It is usually a waste of time to do it. These two would have to stay with us as far as
                Australia. Then they could go on around the world, or go back the way they had come; the distance and
                the accommodations and outlay of time would be just the same, whichever of the two routes they might
                elect to take. Think of it: a projected excursion of five hundred miles gradually enlarged, without any
                elaborate degree of intention, to a possible twenty-four thousand. However, they were used to
                extensions by this time, and did not mind this new one much.</p>

              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>Create and research an application used by Kennedy Krieger Center for Autism and Related
                 Disorders children to address the main concept of self-Advocacy in students for health. 
                 The application is for the children to improve self advocacy by letting them go through a
                  questionaire along side with a game to grow and nurture plants and give them a reason to
                   come back to the application on the daily basis which could keep track of their health.The
                    children wouldn't know that they are scrutinised and would be honest about the how they feel 
                    everyday and this way the teachers could keep a track of the childrens health</p>

            <div class="content__item-text">
              <p>When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted with a young American couple who
                had among their belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven—attractive but not practicably
                companionable with me, because he knew no English. He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas
                on his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and would learn no other. The family
                removed to America a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy began to lose his
                Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had
                wholly departed from his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when he was twenty-one, I
                came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York, and the mother told me about an adventure
                which her son had been having. By trade he was now a professional diver. A passenger boat had been
                caught in a storm on the lake, and had gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the
                young diver descended, with his armor on, and entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the
                foot of the companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water. Presently something
                touched him on the shoulder, and he turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and
                seemingly inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with fright.</p>
              <p>His entry had disturbed the water, and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him and
                wagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance. His senses forsook
                him, and in that condition he was drawn to the surface. He was put to bed at home, and was soon very
                ill. During some days he had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; and while they
                lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and Kanaka only. He was still very ill, and he talked
                to me in that tongue; but I did not understand it, of course. The doctor-books tell us that cases like
                this are not uncommon. Then the doctors ought to study the cases and find out how to multiply them.
                Many languages and things get mislaid in a person’s head, and stay mislaid for lack of this remedy.</p>
              <p>Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were sent ashore; but nobody could go ashore
                and return. There were people on shore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we could not
                receive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term in Sydney. They could have escaped the day
                before, by ship to San Francisco; but the bars had been put up, now, and they might have to wait weeks
                before any ship could venture to give them a passage any whither. And there were hardships for others.
                An elderly lady and her son, recreation-seekers from Massachusetts, had wandered westward, further and
                further from home, always intending to take the return track, but always concluding to go still a
                little further; and now here they were at anchor before Honolulu positively their last westward-bound
                indulgence—they had made up their minds to that—but where is the use in making up your mind in this
                world? It is usually a waste of time to do it. These two would have to stay with us as far as
                Australia. Then they could go on around the world, or go back the way they had come; the distance and
                the accommodations and outlay of time would be just the same, whichever of the two routes they might
                elect to take. Think of it: a projected excursion of five hundred miles gradually enlarged, without any
                elaborate degree of intention, to a possible twenty-four thousand. However, they were used to
                extensions by this time, and did not mind this new one much.</p>

              <p>When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted with a young American couple who
                had among their belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven—attractive but not practicably
                companionable with me, because he knew no English. He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas
                on his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and would learn no other. The family
                removed to America a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy began to lose his
                Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had
                wholly departed from his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when he was twenty-one, I
                came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York, and the mother told me about an adventure
                which her son had been having. By trade he was now a professional diver. A passenger boat had been
                caught in a storm on the lake, and had gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the
                young diver descended, with his armor on, and entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the
                foot of the companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water. Presently something
                touched him on the shoulder, and he turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and
                seemingly inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with fright.</p>
              <p>His entry had disturbed the water, and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him and
                wagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance. His senses forsook
                him, and in that condition he was drawn to the surface. He was put to bed at home, and was soon very
                ill. During some days he had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; and while they
                lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and Kanaka only. He was still very ill, and he talked
                to me in that tongue; but I did not understand it, of course. The doctor-books tell us that cases like
                this are not uncommon. Then the doctors ought to study the cases and find out how to multiply them.
